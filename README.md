## Contento Enigma Starter Kit

This is a styled website starter kit based around a tech startup that has a page builder template, header and footer navs and a basic collection of
composable content blocks. It’s designed to get you started using Contento, and is built with a familiar and popular
tech stack ([Next.js](https://nextjs.org) & [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)).

## Getting Started

First, install all the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, rename the `.env.sample` file to `.env`.

In your [Contento Account Settings](https://app.contento.io/account/api-keys) create a new API Key for this site, copy the value given to you in the dialog
and then paste it into your `.env` file as the value of the `CONTENTO_API_KEY` key.

Now navigate to the Sites screen, and find your new site. Copy the ID of it from here, and paste it into your `.env` as
the value of the `CONTENTO_SITE_ID` key.

Next, load up your new site by clicking on it in the Sites screen, and then navigate to the Content panel. Click into
the Main Nav and copy the ID from the right hand side panel. Paste this into your `.env` as the value of the
`SITE_MAIN_NAV_ID` key. Do the same for the Footer Nav, and paste it as the value of the `SITE_FOOTER_NAV_ID` key.

At this point, you can run the development server and get coding:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
